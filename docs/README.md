# Scala

This is my Scala learning repository. Until now I have always used note taking app like OneNote to save and highlight what I found as an important during my learning process of a new language.

However, by accident I found [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) markdown generator and in my opinion it looks nice. So I decided to take my notes in Markdown format and share them in to form of webpage.
